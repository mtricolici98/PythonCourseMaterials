# Prime Number Checker

Write a Python function called `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime or not. The function should take
one argument: `number` (integer) representing the number to be checked. The function should return a boolean value
indicating whether the number is prime.

Hint: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Write a program that uses the `is_prime` function to do the following:

1. Prompt the user to enter a number.
2. Call the `is_prime` function with the provided input.
3. Print whether the number is prime or not.

Example Output:

```
Enter a number: 17
Prime number: True

Enter a number: 8
Prime number: False
```

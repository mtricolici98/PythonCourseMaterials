# Fibonacci Sequence

Write a Python function called `generate_fibonacci` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.
The function should take one argument: `terms` (integer) indicating the number of Fibonacci terms to generate. The
function should return a list containing the Fibonacci sequence.

Hint: The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

Write a program that uses the `generate_fibonacci` function to do the following:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate.
2. Call the `generate_fibonacci` function with the provided input.
3. Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.

Example Output:

```
Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 8
Generated Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

Enter the number of Fibonacci terms to generate: 5
Generated Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

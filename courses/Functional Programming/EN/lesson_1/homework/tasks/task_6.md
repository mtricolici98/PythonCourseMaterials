# Palindrome Checker

Write a Python function called `is_palindrome` that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function should
take one argument: `text` (string) representing the text to be checked. The function should return a boolean value
indicating whether the text is a palindrome.

Hint: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward,
disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Write a program that uses the `is_palindrome` function to do the following:

1. Prompt the user to enter a text.
2. Call the `is_palindrome` function with the provided input.
3. Print whether the text is a palindrome or not.

Example Output:

```
Enter a text: radar
Palindrome: True

Enter a text: Hello
Palindrome: False
```

Note: The palindrome checker can be customized to ignore or consider spaces, punctuation, or capitalization based on
your preference.

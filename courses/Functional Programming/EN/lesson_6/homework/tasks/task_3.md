# How fast is it ?

Create a decorator that will count the time that it took for a function to complete.

The decorator should be called benchmark_time and should show at the end of every function call of the function that it
decorates, the amount in seconds of the time it took to complete.

Bonus points if you can also print the name of the function being called (decorated).

# Dish Menu

Create a program where the user has 2 options.

* List all dishes
    * Prints out all dishes from a file
* Add dish
    * Adds a dish and saves it to the file

The program should save the list of dishes to a file. (Use JSON to store the information inside the file)

If the user closes the program and opens it again. List all dishes should print out the previously saved list of dishes.

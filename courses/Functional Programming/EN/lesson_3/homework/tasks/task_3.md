## Dice thrower

Using the `random` Module, create a small program that will simulate 2 x 6 sided dice.

The program should allow the user to roll the dice, and show the values on each dice, and the total sum.

Improve the exercise above to let the user pick how many sides the Dice has and how many dice there are.

After the dice are configured, let the user roll the dice until STOP.

> Bonus points: Making the program display the dices nicely.

For example (a bad one but still...):

```
# Three
------------
| x        |
|    x     |
|       x  |
------------


# five
---------
|  x  x |
|    x  |
|  x  x |
---------
# Two
---------
|       |
|  x  x |
|       |
---------
```

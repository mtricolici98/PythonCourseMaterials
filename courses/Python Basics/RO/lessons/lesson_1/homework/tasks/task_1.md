Open a Terminal or CMD window and type:

```bash
python --version
```

This should show the version you just installed.

Then type `python` to open the python interpreter. You should see something like the example below.

```
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jun  9 2023, 07:59:55) [GCC 12.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

Lastly, type in the following code.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

The program will show `Hello World` on the next line and that is it.

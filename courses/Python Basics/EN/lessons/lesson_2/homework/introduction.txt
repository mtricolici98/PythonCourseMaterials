Instructions

There are 3 different types of exercises

* If you find code that contains `___`, you need to replace `___` with your own code.
* If the exercise does not contain code, you need to write all the code yourself.
* If an exercise has errors, you need to make the program work correctly by fixing the errors.

> Errors are easy to notice: The IDE will underline them with red.

## Participants Survey

From user input create two separate lists that represent the names of participants present at three different events.

Using set operations (after you transform the lists to sets), find out the following info.

* Which of the participants have participated at **all** events.
* Which of the participants have only participated at the first event.
* Which of the participants have only participated at the second event.
* Which of the participants from the 1st event participated also at the 3rd event ?

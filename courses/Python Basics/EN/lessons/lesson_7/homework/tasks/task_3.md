## Prime check

Write a program that will check that a given number (from input) is prime or not.

A number is prime if it can only be divided by 1 and itself. You can check the divisors using the modulo function.

Number 5 is prime because:
5 % 1 == 0
5 % 2 == 1
5 % 3 == 2
5 % 4 == 1
5 % 5 == 0

Every number other than 1 and 5 is **not** a divisor.

**Implement this exercise using both For and While loops**

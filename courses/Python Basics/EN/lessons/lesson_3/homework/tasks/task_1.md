Create 2 variables, x and y, whose values are read from the keyboard.

Use the int() function to convert the read values into integers.

* Define the variable **sum**, which will be equal to the sum of x and y.
* Define the variable **diff** which will be equal to x - y (the difference of x and y).
* Define the variable **rest_impart** which will be equal to the remainder of dividing x by y.
* Define the variable **mult** which will be equal to x multiplied by y.
* Define the variable **power3** which will be equal to x to the power of 3.

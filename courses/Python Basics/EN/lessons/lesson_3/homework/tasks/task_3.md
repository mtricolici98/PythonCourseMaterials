Declare a variable named "price" of type int, which will store the price of a product read from the keyboard.

* Calculate how much 30% of the initial price represents and save the value in the variable "reduction."
* Subtract the reduction value, calculated in the previous step, from the initial price. Save the value in the variable "final_price."
* Create a new variable named "price_minus_100_lei" and save in this variable how much the initial price is minus 100 lei.

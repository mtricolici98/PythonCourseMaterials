## Control Flow

Write a program that takes a sentence as input. The program should count the letters of each word that start
with the letters 'A' and 'T', (case insensitive), and print those words and collect the sum of the lengths of those
words. If the word starts with any other letter, it must print "Skipping _word_" and continue to the next one.
The solution **must** incorporate the `continue` statement.

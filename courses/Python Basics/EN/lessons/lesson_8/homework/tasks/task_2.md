## Limited sum

Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input. The program should calculate the product of all the numbers in
the list. However, if the product exceeds 100, the program should stop calculating and print a message indicating
that the product is too large. Use a `for` loop and the `break` statement to terminate the loop when necessary.

> Implement it using both **for** and **while** loops.

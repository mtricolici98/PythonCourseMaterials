# Extending the list class

Make a new class **NumbersList** that extends the `list` class.

The **NumbersList** class should only allow for numeric values (int and float) to be added to the list.

This means you have to overwrite the `__init__, append, extend` functions.

Add additional methods as described below:

* get_sum() - returns the sum of all the values
* get_average() - returns the average value of all numbers in the list
